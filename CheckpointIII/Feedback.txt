Feedback on Checkpoint III:

- Dashboard has 4 visualizations
- Each question has to involve at least 2 visualizations
- Each visuailization must be used in at least 2 questions
- Using a visualization in a question doesn't mean it will answer the question, it can be used 
to simply put a filter for example...
- When you interact with one visualization, all the other must change according to that interaction, 
everything must be interactive, transitions matter
- Have filters by country, year, and use when it applies

-----------------------------
- Using a map, it has to be easy to select a country
- It's not a scatterplot, it's a line chart
- Parallel coordinate plots don't make sense in the case of Early leavers and Adult Participation in 
Learning, years are not to be ordinal so you can't change their order
- Heatmaps are ok, years missing
- Map can be used to show more information than just the time spent reading
